# Machinelearningproject
This project was developed as part of the prestigious Microsoft Engage program. 
A recommendation model is an advanced algorithm designed to suggest personalized content or services to users based on their past behaviors and preferences.
Major companies like Netflix and Google leverage vast user data to implement cutting-edge recommendation systems that offer the most relevant and engaging content, 
thereby increasing user engagement.

In this project, we will develop a recommendation model using Collaborative Filtering, a powerful technique that allows us to recommend movies tailored to 
individual users. By analyzing user interactions and preferences, our model will provide movie recommendations that are personalized and optimized for each user's 
taste and interests, and to run this "python app.py"
Stay tuned for more updates on our GitHub repository as we work on building this exciting movie recommendation system!

# Here is a demo of the project!!
